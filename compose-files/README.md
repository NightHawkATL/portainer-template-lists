# Compose-File

This section houses some of the compose files I use for docker to spin up containers quickly. You will need to edit them to work with your personal storage preferences and provide any passwords that are needed or other specific data or info ("${DATA_HERE}" locations).

I have recently put the "docker-compose.yaml" files into their respective folders to make it a little easier to adopt the stack or conatiner into Docker Compose or Portainer.
