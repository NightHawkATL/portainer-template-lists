# Compose-File

This section houses some of the compose files I use for docker to spin up containers quickly. You will need to edit them to work with your personal storage preferences and provide any passwords that are needed or other specific data or info.

In order to use these correctly, you will either need to copypasta them into a file named "docker-compose.yaml" or download the file and rename it to "docker-compose.yaml".
