This was built to include gluetun as a VPN encapsulator for searxng to allow for searching to only go through a VPN to further obfuscate searching through any of the providers that searxng supports for search aggregation.

I have added links to most of the relevant pages on the Gluetun GitHub page to provide more information about the different settings and options. 

Gluetun works best with paid VPN providers as there is great documentation on most of the popular services. They also have documentation on using custom providers and even an option for using Wireguard with PIA, but it is not supported within the project yet.
